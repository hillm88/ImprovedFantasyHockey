# ImprovedFantasyHockey

<h3>The goal of this project is to create a webapp that will allow users to input all of their fantasy hockey players teams and then 
use a web scraper to grab the current weeks nhl schedule for each team. From here, an algorithm will take a look at each teams games and what positions will be overfilled on some days
and recoomend you a few positions/players to drop and which teams to add players from.</h3>

<ol>
  <li>(Completed)First I need to make a website that will take user inputs for all of the positions.</li>
  <li>Secondly, I need to communicate the user input to the backend.</li>
  <li>Third, I need to use a web scraper to get the current weeks nhl schedule</li>
  <li>Fourth, I need to store this weeks nhl schedule in a database</li>
  <li>Fifth, I need to then figure out what days a person has a overfull lineup</li>
  <li>Sixth, I need to also figure out if the user could gain a few games on off days</li>
  <li>Seventh, I need to then figure out what teams the user can add players from to help their schedule.</li>
  <li>Lastly, I need to then display the results.</li>
</ol>
